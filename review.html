        <p>
          For my website, what I did was started with a basic paper pieces, like a paper jigsaw puzzle that I could move around and reorder as I wanted to to see what pieces would look like in different places.
          <br>
          What I ended up settling for was a main page which is the 'about me' page which is at the top on a nav bar for the about me and assignment pages.
          <br>
          After clicking on the assignment page it has another navigation bar for units one and two.
          <br>
          Under unit one there is yet another navigation bar for the three outcomes. Under outcome one is all of the seperate segments of unit 1, outcome one. The same for outcome two and three.
          <br>
          <br>
          
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are some of the ideas I had for this website before we started it.
        </p>

  <!-- Idea 1 -->
  <p> First Idea <p>
    <img class="one" src="First Idea.png" width="400" height="250">

  <!-- Idea 2 -->
  <p> Second Idea <p>
    <img class="one" src="Second Idea.png" width="400" height="250">

  <!-- Idea 3 -->
  <p> Third Idea<p>
    <img class="one" src="Final design part 1.png" width="400" height="250">

    <img class="one" src="Final design part 2.png" width="400" height="250">

    <p> 
        The third idea is the one this one has been designed from, but as you can see I have changed things a little bit, such as my picture placement and the border styling.
