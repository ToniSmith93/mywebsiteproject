          <p>IT has many purposes in the workplace and with the advancement in technology there is barely a business who does not use IT.
            <br>
            <br>
            It's used in Websites, where without websites a lot of busnisses would not get many customers since a lot of people like to shop online rather than peruse shops full of crowds and ques that take up their time. If a company doesn't have a website they can lose customers to their rivals who do have a website. A website gives people easy access to information about your buisness.
            <br>
            So while it can be expensive to set up a website, at first, it is worth it in the long run as increasingly more views come from a website in the modern era than they do from high street stores as the internet is readily available. 
            <br>
            Spreadsheets are used in a lot of buisnesses, especially finance and accounting departments. They allow you to input data and get output based on the information you put into the cells and rows. So for example a buisness selling car parts could list the car parts and the price and how many they have sold on that day. and then get the total earned at the end of the month.
            <br>
            An example of spreadsheets that I can think of is organising contact information such as an email and phone number.
            I created this example in Excel:-

            IT in modern buisnesses is used for security. Security technology is very important for employee safety and authorising access. Security can include things like cameras, computer logins, fingerprint scanners and automatic lockdown systems.
            <br>
            There are also specific guidelines that have to be followed in busnisses to make sure things like company details and customer details are kept safe, these guides will be covered a little bit in 1.2 but mostly covered in 1.7.
            <br>
            But some of them include:
            <br>
            Accuracy, accountability, integrity and confidentiality
