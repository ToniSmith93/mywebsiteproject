          <p>
            There are seven GDPR principles that have to be followed.
            <br>
            These are:
            <br>
            ⦁	Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
            <br>
            -  You must clearly state what you intend to use someones personal details for and that you do not use the data that breaches the laws or process the data in any way that is misleading.
            <br>
            ⦁	Purpose limitation
            <br>
            - To use someone's personal data for a new purpose you must first get consent or you have a clear obligation set out by law.
            <br>
            ⦁	Data minimisation
            <br>
            - Make sure that it is limited to what is necessary and that you are not holding information that is irrelivent to what you need but only use enough to make sure it is sufficiant to fulfil your stated purpose.
            <br>
            ⦁	Accuracy
            <br>
            - If there is a problem with the data and/or it's usage you must make sure that it is corrected as soon as possible.
            <br>
            ⦁	Storage limitation
            <br>
            - By law you are not allowed to hold onto personal details for longer than you need them and periodically review the data that you hold. The owner of the data has the right to request that you delete their data if you no longer need it.
            <br>
            ⦁	Integrity and confidentiality (Security)
            <br>
            - This guideline means that you must have the correct security in place to avoid personal data to be compromised either by cybersecurity methods or physical for data such as files on someone.
            <br>
            ⦁	Accountability principle
            <br>
            - In short it means that you are responsible and accountable for personal data that you have collected and are liable for keeping it safe while you need it.
