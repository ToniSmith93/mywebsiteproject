        <p>SO I created this website as part of a course I attended at Code Nation. I started this course because someone I knew told me about it and we attended it together since I was already interested in programming and we thought it would be great to go on this course together. 
          <br>
          I've always been interested in computers, but I also love the outdoors too, camping with a good tent and sleeping bag and you can't forget a good campfire and a few drinks. There's just something great about being able to lie back and look at the stars while hearing the sound of nature or even nothing, rather than the music of noisy neighbours and people shouting.
          <br>
          I also enjoy reading, some books and short stories I've read include:
